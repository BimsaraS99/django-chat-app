This GitHub repository showcases a chat application built using Django, a powerful web framework in Python. The chat app allows users to create an unlimited number of chat rooms, with the flexibility to have any number of members within each room.

Technologies Used:
- Python: The core programming language used for implementing the server-side logic and backend functionality of the chat application.
- Django: A high-level Python web framework that simplifies the development process by providing various tools and libraries for building robust web applications.
- jQuery: A popular JavaScript library that simplifies client-side scripting and enhances the interaction between the user and the web application.
- Ajax: A technique used to asynchronously exchange data between the client and server, enabling real-time updates and seamless user experience.
- HTML: The markup language used to structure the content and elements of the web pages in the chat application.
- CSS: The styling language responsible for the visual presentation and layout of the chat app, ensuring an attractive and user-friendly interface.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The coding paradigm employed to organize and manage the codebase, leveraging the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism for modular and maintainable code.

The repository contains the complete source code of the chat application, allowing other developers to explore, learn, and contribute to the project. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the implementation details and best practices of building a chat app using Django, jQuery, Ajax, HTML, CSS, and following object-oriented programming principles.
